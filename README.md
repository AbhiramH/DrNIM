# DrNIM
This is an attempt at recreating the game Dr.NIM, a popular board game from the 60's.

Inspired by this video by Matt Parker from StandUpMaths : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg

Here's the game manual : http://www.one-leggedsandpiper.com/Christmas/Presents/Dr-Nim-Manual.pdf

NOTE : In this game, the goal is to force your opponent to take the last marble and not what is told in the linked video.
